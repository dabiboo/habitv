
Lucid menu is a highly customizable module which replaces the current menus with new ones. Its idea was heavily influenced by the wonderful nice_menus but attempts to provide more customization options, it is also compatible with drupal 5. Almost every aspect of this module is customizable. It uses the doIMenu 1.5.3 by Donna Iwan Setiawan
